## 4th Question:

# Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Power Generation

## Principle of Operation

MHD power generation is based on **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**, which states that a voltage is induced when a conductor moves through a magnetic field. In MHD generation:

1. **Ionized Gas Flow**: High-temperature ionized gas (plasma), often created by burning fossil fuels or other energy sources, flows at high speeds through a magnetic field in the generator channel.
2. **Electromagnetic Induction**: As the ionized gas (conductive fluid) flows perpendicular to the magnetic field, charged particles in the plasma experience a Lorentz force, causing them to move, creating an electric current.
3. **Electrode Collection**: Electrodes on the sides of the MHD channel collect this generated current, which is then used for power output.

This method produces direct current (DC) power directly from the kinetic energy of the hot, ionized gases without moving parts, making it highly efficient.
