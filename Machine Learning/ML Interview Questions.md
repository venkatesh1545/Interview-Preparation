## Answers

### What is Machine Learning?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data, improve their performance on a task over time without being explicitly programmed, and make predictions or decisions based on new data.
</details>

### What are the different types of Machine Learning?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
- **Supervised Learning** : The model is trained on labeled data, where the input comes with corresponding output. Examples include regression and classification tasks.

- **Unsupervised Learning** : The model is trained on unlabeled data, identifying patterns and relationships without predefined labels. Examples include clustering and association.
- **Semi-supervised Learning** : Combines both labeled and unlabeled data for training, often using a small amount of labeled data to improve learning from a larger pool of unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning** : An agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward, receiving feedback from actions.
</details>

### What is the difference between classification and regression?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
- **Classification** : A supervised learning task where the output variable is categorical (e.g., spam or not spam). The goal is to predict discrete labels.
- **Regression** : A supervised learning task where the output variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices). The goal is to predict real-valued outputs.
</details>

### What is overfitting and underfitting?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
- **Overfitting** : Occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization on new data. It results in high accuracy on training data but low accuracy on validation/test data.
- **Underfitting** : Occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.
</details>

### How can you prevent overfitting?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
Strategies to prevent overfitting include:
- **Cross-validation** : Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
- **Regularization** : Techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization add a penalty to the loss function to constrain model complexity.
- **Pruning** : In decision trees, remove branches that have little importance.
- **Dropout** : In neural networks, randomly drop units during training to prevent co-adaptation.
- **Simplifying the model** : Reducing the complexity of the model (e.g., fewer layers in a neural network) can help.
</details>

### What is a confusion matrix?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model by showing the counts of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.
</details>

### What are precision and recall?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Precision** : The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It indicates the accuracy of positive predictions. 
  
- **Recall (Sensitivity)** : The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. It measures the model's ability to identify positive instances.

### What is the bias-variance tradeoff?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the balance between two sources of error in a model:
- **Bias** : Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm, leading to underfitting.
- **Variance** : Error due to excessive complexity in the model, leading to overfitting. The goal is to find a model that minimizes both bias and variance to achieve better generalization.
</details>

### What is feature engineering?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves transforming data into a format that better represents the underlying problem and enhances the model's ability to learn.
</details>

### What is a decision tree?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the dataset into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an output label. Decision trees are interpretable and easy to visualize.
</details>

### What are ensemble methods?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models to create a stronger overall model. The main types of ensemble methods include:
- **Bagging** : (e.g., Random Forest) reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.
- **Boosting** : (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) sequentially builds models, where each model focuses on correcting errors made by the previous ones, thereby reducing bias and improving performance.
</details>

### What is cross-validation?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how a machine learning model will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the training data into multiple subsets (folds) and training the model multiple times, each time using a different fold for validation and the rest for training. The most common method is k-fold cross-validation.
</details>

### What is the role of hyperparameters in machine learning?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
Hyperparameters are configuration settings used to control the learning process and the model's architecture. They are set before training and affect the model's performance. Examples include learning rate, regularization strength, number of trees in a random forest, and the number of layers in a neural network. Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing model performance.
</details>

### Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
- **Supervised Learning** : Involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is known, to make predictions or classifications. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.
- **Unsupervised Learning** : Involves training a model on unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures without predefined labels. Examples include clustering (K-means) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
</details>

### What is deep learning, and how does it differ from traditional machine learning?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data. The key differences are:
- **Data Requirements** : Deep learning typically requires more data to perform well than traditional machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Extraction** : Deep learning automatically learns features from raw data, while traditional machine learning often requires manual feature extraction and selection.
- **Model Complexity** : Deep learning models can capture more complex patterns due to their depth, whereas traditional machine learning models are usually simpler.
</details>

### What is a neural network?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection has an associated weight, and the network learns by adjusting these weights based on the input data and the output it generates. Neural networks can be used for various tasks, including classification, regression, and feature extraction.
</details>

### Explain the concepts of activation functions.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  
Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include:
- **Sigmoid** : Outputs values between 0 and 1, useful for binary classification.
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs zero for negative inputs and the input value for positive inputs, commonly used in hidden layers of deep networks.
- **Softmax** : Converts raw scores into probabilities for multi-class classification tasks.
</details>

### What is feature scaling, and why is it important?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Feature scaling is the process of normalizing or standardizing the range of independent variables or features in the data. It is important because many machine learning algorithms perform better or converge faster when features are on a relatively similar scale and close to normally distributed. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and Standardization (Z-score normalization).
</details>

### What are some common metrics for evaluating model performance?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Common metrics include:
- **Accuracy** : The proportion of correct predictions among total predictions.
- **Precision** : The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.
- **Recall** : The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- **F1 Score** : The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC** : Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
</details>

### What is the purpose of regularization in machine learning?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of the model parameters. Common regularization techniques include:
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)** : Encourages sparsity in the model parameters by adding the absolute value of coefficients to the loss function.
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)** : Adds the squared value of coefficients to the loss function, penalizing larger coefficients more heavily.
